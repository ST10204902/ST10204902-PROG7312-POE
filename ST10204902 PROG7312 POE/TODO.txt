  * Fix ExtractMin() to properly maintain heap properties
  * Add UpdatePriority() method with heap rebalancing
  * Add proper priority-based sorting

- Complete BST implementation
  * Add proper balancing (AVL or Red-Black)
  * Implement all traversal methods:
    - In-order traversal
    - Pre-order traversal
    - Post-order traversal
